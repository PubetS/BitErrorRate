# BitErrorRate

Bit Error Rate is the number of digital bit ("0" or "1") error with resprct to total number of transmited bit. 

this code consisting of 2 part, the 1st has been computed by use arduino digital pin. The secound has been computed by use arduino analog pin with a voltage level to comparation data bit.
